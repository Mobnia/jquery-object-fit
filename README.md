Postcard solves problems with displaying variable image dimensions in the browser.

Many times if you've worked with user generated image content, you'll find that many users hardly follow your advice for best image dimensions.

Common solutions to this problem includes providing a cropper to force the user to re-dimension their images or your resize the images to varying thumbnail sizes
e.g. small-thumb, mid-thumb, large-thumb
